This projecct is trying to identify different mushroom species from photos of mushrooms. The goal is to input an image of a mushroom and the output should be the species of that mushroom. We are using a dataset that contains about one hundred thousand photos of 169 different species of mushroom. The dataset consists of the mushroom pictures and 3 .csv files that link the pictures to the mushroom species. The type of the data is categorial, since the mushrooms are divided into 169 species which are in a sense different categories. Our dataset is from kaggle and is compiled by Leonardo Cofone.

This machine learning problem is a multi-class image classification problem. The images used as input are multidimensional, because each image consists of 224x224 pixels, and each pixel consists of 3 rgb values. This means that as a starting point, we have 224x224x3 = 150528 features per image, and each feature is an 8 bit RGB value that represents pixel intensity.

This project will use supervised learning, since we already know the correct output and are trying to teach the model the mappings on how to categorize the data correctly. The labels we will be using are the correct categories for each image, meaning that we have in total 169 possible labels. Each of the successfully classified images will have one label. The model that we are using will be the CNN, the convolutional neural network.
